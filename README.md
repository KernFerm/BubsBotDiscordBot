## Introducing 🤖BubsBot🤖 for Your Discord Server

🤖BubsBot🤖 is a specialized Discord bot, meticulously crafted to enhance the management and moderation of your server. It is equipped with the capability to automatically delete messages that contain "@everyone" or "@here" from non-admin users, ensuring a spam-free environment for your community. 

In addition, it enforces discipline by timing out non-admin users who send such messages, for a duration of 24 hours. This feature acts as a deterrent, promoting a respectful and orderly communication within your server. 

With 🤖BubsBot🤖, experience a seamless, secure, and superior server management like never before.

## Adding 🤖BubsBot🤖 to Your Server

To add 🤖BubsBot🤖 to your Discord server, you'll need to follow these steps:

### 🤖Bot Token:🪙
- (a) The developer of 🤖BubsBot🤖 will `NOT` provide you with a bot token. This token allows the bot to authenticate with Discord's API and perform actions on your server.
- (b) You need to replace the `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` in the `bubsbot.py` file with your bot's token.

### 🔗Invite Link:🔗
- (a) The developer `will provide you with an invite link` for the bot. Use this link to invite the bot to your Discord server.

### Timeout Role:
- (a) Create a role on your Discord server for timing out users. This role should have no permissions. 
- (b) The role name should be called: `Timeout Role`
- (c) For The `Timeout Role` : **View Channel** , **Disable Send Messages** , **Enable Read Chat History**
- (d) Make Sure To add The `Timeout Role` to every channel in your discord server. Make sure to set the `Timeout Role` for each channel, **🚨you will have to do that!!🚨**

### 🤖Bot Configuration:⚙️
- (a) Once the bot is added to your server, it is set to run as intended. No modifications to the `bubsbot.py` file are allowed as they may affect its functionality.
- (b) The bot's command prefix and the name of the timeout role are pre-configured and should not be changed to ensure the bot works properly.
- (c) The `/test` command is specifically designed to work only for the server owner or users with the ADMIN role. No additional configuration is necessary for this command.

- for admin role **view channel** & **administrator**

       copy & paste for role ->  SERVER OWNER/ADMIN   <- copy & paste for role

- (d) If you need to make any changes or adjustments, please contact the developer. Unauthorized modifications are not allowed and may lead to the bot malfunctioning.

### 🤖Bot Commands:🎮
- `/daily`: Use this command to claim your daily rewards in the form of coins.
- `/coins`: Use this command to check the total number of coins you have accumulated.
- `/change_status`: Use this command to change the bot's status for the server. This command is only available to the server owner or users with the ADMIN role.
- The bot also has built-in anti-spam features. Users who spam or misuse the `@everyone` or `@here` commands will be timed out for 24 hours. `This does not affect users with the SERVER OWNER/ADMIN role or the server owner.` After the timeout period, the bot will automatically remove the user from timeout.

Please note that these commands are case-sensitive and should be used exactly as shown.

### Create A 🥳Daily Rewards🥳 Channel: `so you can do the /daily /coins`
